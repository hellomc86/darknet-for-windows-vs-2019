# darknet-for-windows-vs-2019
Darknet on Visual Studio 2019 for windows
I build darknet from http://guanghan.info/blog/en/my-works/train-yolo/ on visual studio for 2019 
Original one uses visual studio 2015
I was just doing a project and build it on visual studio 2019
I tought maybe it will be usefull for others who wishes to run Yolo on Windows
